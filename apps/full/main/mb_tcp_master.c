/* Why this is not the component's own TCP master.
 *
 * mbc_master_create_tcp() is given its whole node list at once, in
 * tcp_opts.ip_addr_table, and its parameter descriptors once more through
 * mbc_master_set_descriptor(). The public API has no way to change either
 * afterwards -- only create, start, stop, delete. These eight entries are
 * rows in a web form: correcting the address of one of them would mean
 * tearing down the master and rebuilding it, taking the other seven off the
 * air for as long as that takes, on every save.
 *
 * Reading registers over TCP is also the one part of Modbus that is nearly
 * all framing, and the framing is already here: mb_pdu.c builds the request
 * and checks the answer, with no dependency on the component or on the
 * board, which is why it can be and is tested on a development machine. What
 * is left below that is a socket and a clock. */
