/* Why this is not the component's own TCP slave.
 *
 * That one serves every connection from a single task and answers each
 * request before reading the next. A request this board answers itself takes
 * about 50 ms; one forwarded to a silent device takes 650. With one task the
 * second kind delays the first -- measured, a local read that took 52 ms
 * alone took 594 ms alongside a request to an address nobody answers.
 *
 * So connections and requests are separated. One task polls every connection
 * and never blocks on receiving at all -- it takes what has arrived and comes
 * back -- and the work goes to a pool of workers, one request at a time. It
 * never waits on a send either: what is left of an answer stays with its
 * connection and goes out when the socket can take it, and a client that has
 * not taken its answer within SEND_WAIT_MS is dropped. A worker occupied with the segment holds up
 * nothing else, and an idle connection occupies no worker at all -- which is
 * why the pool is per request and not per connection: Modbus clients keep
 * their connections open for hours.
 *
 * The segment itself still carries one transaction at a time; that is
 * physics, and mb_gateway_handle() serialises for it. What the pool buys is
 * that everything which does NOT need the segment goes straight through. */
