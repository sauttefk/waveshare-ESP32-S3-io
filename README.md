Generic firmware based on ESP-IDF for
the [Waveshare ESP32-S3-POE-ETH-8DI-8DO](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-POE-ETH-8DI-8DO)
and [Waveshare ESP32-S3-POE-ETH-8DI-8RO](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-ETH-8DI-8RO) industrial I/O expansion
modules.

The firmware that comes with those devices is relatively limited and hard to use without modifying and flashing it.
Having open hardware that lets one tinker with it is great and something to like about the Waveshare products.
However, sometimes you want something that just works out of the box — and this is where this project might come in handy.

The project ships **two firmware flavors**. The Matter/CHIP SDK consumes too much DMA-capable RAM to coexist with the
full feature set in a single binary, so the features are split across two separate applications that share the same
board hardware abstraction layer (`components/board/`):

| Flavor | Binary | What it includes |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **Full** (`apps/full/`) | `waveshare_esp32s3_full.bin` | [WiFi provisioning](#connectivity), [Ethernet](#connectivity), [Rule engine](#automation-rules), [MQTT](#mqtt), [CAN bus](#can-bus), [Modbus RTU](#modbus-rtu), [full web UI](#web-configuration-ui) — **no Matter** |
| **Matter** (`apps/matter/`) | `waveshare_esp32s3_matter.bin` | [WiFi provisioning](#connectivity), [Ethernet](#connectivity), [Matter](#matter) (Apple Home / Google Home), minimal web UI — no rule engine, no MQTT |

**If you are not sure which to use, start with the full firmware** — it is what the CI builds and the releases contain.

## Features

### Connectivity

- **WiFi provisioning** — on first boot the device opens a `Waveshare-Setup` access point. Connect to it on any device;
  a captive portal appears automatically to enter WiFi credentials. The LED blinks 30% blue while the portal is active.
- **ETH-only mode** — if you have an Ethernet cable, tap **"Use Ethernet only →"** on the provisioning portal to skip
  WiFi entirely. The preference is stored and survives reboots.
- **Ethernet** — W5500 SPI Ethernet always runs in parallel (or alone in ETH-only mode); whichever interface gets an IP
  first starts the services.
- **DHCP hostname** — the device registers under its configured name (default `Waveshare-ESP32`).
- **Return to WiFi provisioning** — hold the BOOT button (GPIO0) for ≥ 5 s at any time. This clears WiFi credentials,
  clears the ETH-only flag, and reboots into the provisioning portal.

### Authentication

The web UI and REST API are password-protected (CRA-compliant: no hardcoded default password).

**Initial password setup:**

1. Open `http://<device-ip>/` — a setup screen appears because no password has been set yet.
2. Click **"Set up password…"** — the device LED blinks yellow rapidly.
3. Briefly press the BOOT button on the device within 30 s to confirm physical access.
4. Enter and confirm a password (min. 8 characters).

**Subsequent logins:** the browser prompts for the password. Credentials are stored in `sessionStorage` (cleared when
the tab is closed).

**Password reset** (forgotten password): click **"Forgot password?"** on the login screen and repeat the BOOT button
flow — no prior authentication required, physical access is sufficient.

### Web Configuration UI

Served at `http://<device-ip>/` on port 80. Settings include (full firmware):

| Section          | What you can configure                                                      |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Device           | Device name (DHCP hostname), LED mode                                       |
| MQTT Broker      | Broker URL, username/password, topic prefix                                 |
| Digital Inputs   | Per-input name and invert flag                                              |
| Digital Outputs  | Per-output name and invert flag                                             |
| CAN Bus          | Mode (Off / Basic / NMEA2000), address, bit rate                            |
| Modbus RTU       | Enable/disable, slave address, baudrate                                     |
| Automation Rules | JavaScript rule script (see [Automation Rules](#automation-rules))          |

The UI also provides **Save**, **Reboot**, and **Factory Reset** buttons.

#### REST API (full firmware)

All endpoints except the auth flow require an `Authorization: Basic base64(:<password>)` header.
Until a password has been set they answer `403 {"error":"setup_required"}`: a device that has not been
set up yet is closed, not open, and the only way in is the button-confirmed password flow.

| Endpoint                 | Method | Auth required | Description                                      |
|--------------------------|--------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `/api/auth/status`       | GET    | No            | `{"password_set": bool}`                         |
| `/api/auth/begin`        | POST   | No            | Start token flow (LED blinks, 30 s)              |
| `/api/auth/token?s=<id>` | GET    | No            | Poll: `waiting` / `ready` / `timeout`            |
| `/api/auth/set-password` | POST   | No            | `{"token":"…","password":"…"}`                   |
| `/api/config`            | GET    | Yes           | Read full configuration as JSON                  |
| `/api/config`            | POST   | Yes           | Update configuration from JSON                   |
| `/api/reboot`            | POST   | Yes           | Restart immediately                              |
| `/api/factory-reset`     | POST   | Yes           | Erase all settings and restart                   |
| `/api/rules`             | GET    | Yes           | Read the current rule script as `{"script":"…"}` |
| `/api/rules`             | POST   | Yes           | Save + hot-reload rules from `{"script":"…"}`    |

The matter firmware exposes a smaller API: `/api/auth/*`, `/api/config` (subset), `/api/reboot`,
`/api/factory-reset`, `/api/matter/pairing` (GET — QR code + commissioning status), and
`/api/matter/decommission` (POST — erase fabrics and reboot).

### Automation Rules

A built-in rule engine wires digital inputs, digital outputs, and MQTT messages together
with a small JavaScript DSL. Rules are edited in the **Rules** tab of the web UI — a
CodeMirror editor with JavaScript syntax highlighting and line numbers (self-hosted, so it
works on an isolated network) — or via `POST /api/rules`, saved to NVS, and hot-reloaded
without a reboot.

See the **[Rule Language Reference](components/scripting/RULES.md)** for the full syntax —
rule structure, the `input` / `output` / `mqtt` facts and their helpers, time-based rules
(`.heldFor` / `.after`), and rule chaining, with examples throughout. You can prototype and
test rules in the browser with the simulator in [`simulator/`](simulator/) — run
`cd simulator && npm start` and open <http://localhost:3000> (see
[`simulator/README.md`](simulator/README.md)). It runs the live engine source.

### MQTT

Full details in [`docs/mqtt.md`](docs/mqtt.md).

| Resource               | Topics                               |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Digital inputs (read)  | `<prefix>/input/<name-or-1..8>` (1..11 with the extra inputs) |
| Digital outputs (set)  | `<prefix>/output/<name-or-1..8>/set` |
| Digital outputs (bulk) | `<prefix>/output/set`                |
| LED                    | `<prefix>/led/set`                   |
| Buzzer                 | `<prefix>/buzzer/beep`               |

- Input/output topics use a configured channel name, or the index number (1–8) if no name is set — inputs run to 11
  with [`APP_AUX_DI_ENABLE`](#optional-extra-inputs-app_aux_di_enable).
- Output commands accept `true`/`false`/`1`/`0`/`on`/`off`/`high`/`low`/`toggle` (case-insensitive).
- The LED accepts `#RRGGBB`, a timed single step `{"color":"#RRGGBB","duration":ms}`, or a multi-step sequence array.
- The buzzer accepts a single `{"freq":Hz,"duration":ms}` or a sequence array; omit `freq` for silent pauses.

### CAN Bus

Full details in [`docs/can.md`](docs/can.md).

Three selectable modes:

| Mode         | Frame type      | Bit rate     | Description             |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| **Off**      | —               | —            | Disabled                |
| **Basic**    | 11-bit standard | Configurable | Simple custom frame map |
| **NMEA2000** | 29-bit extended | 250 kbit/s   | Standard marine network |

**Basic mode** — a compact 6-frame protocol covering DI state, DO set/echo (WRITE/SET/CLEAR/TOGGLE opcodes + bitmask),
LED colour, buzzer, and a read-request trigger.

**NMEA2000 mode** implements ISO address claiming, PGN 126993 Heartbeat, PGN 127501/127502 Binary Switch Banks (DI bank
0, DO bank 1), and PGN 126720 Manufacturer Proprietary fast-packet (LED + buzzer).

### Matter

> Apple Home / Google Home / Home Assistant — separate firmware

Full details in [`docs/matter.md`](docs/matter.md).

Matter support is provided by the **`apps/matter/`** firmware flavor (see [Build & Flash — Matter firmware](#matter-firmware)).
It is **not** present in the full firmware because the CHIP SDK exhausts DMA-capable RAM when combined with
the rule engine and MQTT stack.

Flash `apps/matter/` if you need to integrate the device into Apple Home, Google Home, or Home Assistant via the
Matter protocol. You give up the rule engine, MQTT, CAN bus, and Modbus RTU in exchange.

| Feature               | Description                                                                               |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **8 Digital Outputs** | Exposed as *On/Off Plug-in Unit* endpoints (controllable)                                 |
| **8 Digital Inputs**  | Exposed as *Contact Sensor* endpoints (read-only state)                                   |
| **Pairing code**      | Unique passcode + discriminator generated on first boot; survives reboot and decommission |
| **QR code**           | Shown in the web UI; scan with your home app to pair                                      |
| **Decommission**      | Erase all fabric data via `POST /api/matter/decommission` or the minimal web UI           |
| **Identify**          | LED blinks cyan at 1 Hz when any endpoint's Identify cluster is triggered                 |

**Important — Contact Sensor = Door/Window in most home apps.** Home Assistant, HomeKit, and Google Home all render
Contact Sensor endpoints as door or window sensors (open/closed), not as generic binary sensors. This is correct per the
Matter spec but can look surprising. See [`docs/matter.md`](docs/matter.md) for details on renaming endpoints and
alternative device types.

### Modbus RTU

Full details in [`docs/modbus.md`](docs/modbus.md).

RS-485, configurable baud rate and slave address. Register map:

| Register    | Type                  | Description                           |
|-------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 1–8         | Coil (RW)             | DO1–DO8                               |
| 10001–10008 | Discrete input (RO)   | DI1–DI8                               |
| 40001       | Holding register (RW) | LED colour (RGB252, 16-bit)           |
| 40002       | Holding register (RW) | Buzzer: write frequency → 200 ms beep |

### LED Modes

The WS2812 LED has two operating modes (configurable in the web UI). **Status feedback is the default.**

**IO device mode** — fully controlled via MQTT `led/set`, Modbus HR 40001, and CAN base+3 / NMEA2000 PGN 126720.

**Status feedback mode** — automatic connectivity indicator:

| LED state                | Meaning                              |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 30% yellow (solid)       | Booted, no network yet               |
| 30% blue (slow blink)    | WiFi provisioning portal active      |
| 30% green (solid)        | Network (WiFi or Ethernet) connected |
| 30% purple (solid)       | MQTT broker connected                |
| 100% red flash (100 ms)  | MQTT message received                |
| 100% blue flash (100 ms) | MQTT message published               |

Transitions are evaluated automatically: losing MQTT falls back to green; losing the network falls back to yellow. In
Status mode all LED commands from MQTT, Modbus, and CAN are ignored.

### Input / Output Details

- **Invert flag** — each DI and DO has a configurable invert flag (web UI). Applied consistently across MQTT, Modbus,
  and CAN.
- **Named channels** — each DI/DO can be given a name (up to 20 chars, no `/`, unique per type) that replaces the index
  number in MQTT topics.
- **Debounce** — digital inputs have 10 ms software debounce.
- **Unified state** — a DO write via any interface (MQTT, Modbus, CAN) is reflected immediately on all others. MQTT
  confirmation is published, Modbus coil is updated, CAN echoes the new state.

### Optional Extra Inputs (`APP_AUX_DI_ENABLE`)

> Build-time option, **off by default** — the released binaries do not contain it.

`APP_AUX_DI_ENABLE` adds three further digital inputs on the **IO1, RXD and TXD** pads (GPIO1, GPIO44, GPIO43), behind the eight
isolated ones.
They show up as **AUX1–AUX3** in the web UI and occupy DI indices 8, 9 and 10. Enable it with
`CONFIG_APP_AUX_DI_ENABLE=y` in `apps/full/sdkconfig.defaults`, or in `./idf.sh menuconfig` under
*Board driver options → Three extra NON-ISOLATED digital inputs (GPIO1, GPIO44, GPIO43)*.

**These three pins are not isolated.** They run straight to the ESP32-S3 — no optocoupler, no series resistor, no
reverse protection — and must never see more than 3.3 V or less than 0 V. Conditioning them is up to the external
circuit.

**Important — GPIO43 needs a series resistor of at least 1 kΩ.** GPIO43 is U0TXD, and the ROM bootloader drives it as
a push-pull output from every reset until the second-stage bootloader releases it — and indefinitely while the chip
sits in UART download mode (esptool, BOOT button). A contact wired straight from GPIO43 to ground therefore shorts that
driver on every boot and during every flash. It is deliberately the last channel, so a board that needs only two
extra inputs can leave it unwired. GPIO44 (AUX2, U0RXD) is an input and has no such problem; GPIO1 is otherwise
unused by this firmware.

**The console has to move.** GPIO43/44 are UART0 TX/RX, so the option also requires
`CONFIG_ESP_CONSOLE_USB_SERIAL_JTAG=y` (*Component config → ESP System Settings → Channel for console output →
USB Serial/JTAG Controller*). Building with the console still on UART0 fails with an `#error`.

**Turning the option back off loses the input names.** The per-input settings are stored as one NVS blob. Eleven
entries written by an option-on firmware do not fit the eight-entry buffer of an option-off one, so `nvs_get_blob()`
returns `ESP_ERR_NVS_INVALID_LENGTH` and *every* input name and invert flag falls back to its default — the eight
isolated ones included. Note them down before switching back.

Not every interface grows with the extra channels:

| Interface        | AUX1–AUX3 | Detail                                                              |
|------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Web UI           | yes       | Listed as AUX1–AUX3, marked as not isolated                         |
| REST API         | yes       | `/api/config` and the status JSON carry 11 input entries            |
| MQTT             | yes       | `input/9`, `input/10`, `input/11` — the topic index is DI index + 1 |
| CAN bus          | **no**    | DI state is packed into a single byte — room for 8                  |
| Modbus RTU       | **no**    | Discrete inputs 10001–10008 only                                    |
| Matter           | **no**    | 8 Contact Sensor endpoints, unchanged                               |
| Automation rules | **no**    | `input` / `output` channels are limited to 0–7 (`RangeError` above) |

## Build & Flash

### Prerequisites

- ESP-IDF v5.5.4 — pinned as a git submodule under `esp-idf/`

```sh
# First-time setup (after clone) — installs toolchains for both firmware flavors
git submodule update --init --depth 1 esp-idf components/esp32-wifi-bootstrap components/quickjs/extern/quickjs
./esp-idf/install.sh esp32s3
```

The Matter firmware also requires the `esp-matter` submodule (large — ~1 GB):

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive esp-matter
```

A convenience wrapper `idf.sh` at the project root sources `esp-idf/export.sh` and forwards all arguments to
`idf.py -C apps/full`. Use it to avoid repeating the source step.

### Full firmware

The full firmware (`apps/full/`) includes the rule engine, MQTT, CAN bus, Modbus RTU, and the full web UI.
It does **not** require the `esp-matter` submodule.

```sh
# Build
./idf.sh build

# Flash everything (app + SPIFFS web UI + partition table)
./idf.sh -p /dev/ttyUSBx flash

# App only (fastest — use when only firmware changed)
./idf.sh -p /dev/ttyUSBx app-flash

# SPIFFS only (use when www/ content changed)
./idf.sh -p /dev/ttyUSBx spiffs-flash
```

Alternatively, without the wrapper:

```sh
. ./esp-idf/export.sh
idf.py -C apps/full build
idf.py -C apps/full -p /dev/ttyUSBx flash
```

### Matter firmware

The matter firmware (`apps/matter/`) requires the `esp-matter` submodule to be initialized first (see Prerequisites).

```sh
. ./esp-idf/export.sh
idf.py -C apps/matter build
idf.py -C apps/matter -p /dev/ttyUSBx flash
```

> **Note:** The matter firmware has no SPIFFS partition. There is no `spiffs-flash` target.

### Flashing a release binary

Download `waveshare-esp32s3-<version>-full-flash.zip` from the
[Releases](https://github.com/hennejg/waveshare-ESP32-S3-io/releases/latest) page, unzip, then from the
extracted folder:

```sh
# Full install (first time or after partition layout changes)
python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 -p /dev/ttyUSBx -b 460800 \
  --before default-reset --after hard-reset \
  write-flash --flash-mode dio --flash-freq 80m --flash-size 16MB \
  @flash_args

# App update only
python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 -p /dev/ttyUSBx -b 460800 \
  --before default-reset --after hard-reset \
  write-flash --flash-mode dio --flash-freq 80m --flash-size 16MB \
  0x20000 waveshare_esp32s3_full-<version>.bin
```

### First boot after fresh flash

1. Connect to the `Waveshare-Setup` WiFi AP (or plug in an Ethernet cable and tap "Use Ethernet only" on the portal).
2. After getting an IP, open `http://<device-ip>/`.
3. Follow the password setup flow: click "Set up password…", press BOOT button, set password.

## Why not use...
- **Arduino**? I didn't want to recompile/reflash every time I need a new feature
- **Tasmota**?
  * it doesn't support Modbus
  * it doesn't support CAN bus/NMEA2000
  * it doesn't support Matter
  * its rule engine is rather limited, for example, it is harder to implement fallback behaviours for cases where the upstream management goes down
