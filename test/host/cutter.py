"""Lifting pieces of firmware source into a host test, verbatim.

Both generators here build a test program out of the real C file rather than
out of a copy of it, so the test cannot drift away from the code it guards.
Everything they take -- functions, types, #defines -- comes through this one
module, because the thing that goes wrong is always the same: something is
retyped by hand, the firmware changes, and the test keeps asserting the old
shape while still compiling. Anything not found stops the build.
